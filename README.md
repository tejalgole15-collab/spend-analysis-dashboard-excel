# Procurement Spend Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

# Project Overview
This project analyzes procurement spending data to identify cost distribution patterns, supplier concentration risks, and opportunities for cost optimization.
The dashboard was developed in Excel using Pivot Tables, charts, and KPI tracking to provide management-level visibility into spending behavior.

# Business Problem
Organizations often lack clear visibility into:

- Total spend by category
- Supplier concentration risks
- Monthly spending trends
- High-cost departments

This analysis aims to support better vendor negotiation, cost control, and budget planning.

# Tools Used
- Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Data Cleaning
- KPI Dashboard Design
- Data Visualization

# Dashboard KPIs

- Total Spend
- Spend by Category
- Spend by Supplier
- Monthly Spend Trend
- Top 10 Suppliers
- Department-wise Spend

# Key Insights

- A significant portion of spend is concentrated among a small number of suppliers.
- Certain categories contribute disproportionately to total procurement cost.
- Monthly spending shows seasonal variation.
- Potential negotiation opportunities exist with top vendors.

# Business Recommendations

- Negotiate long-term contracts with high-spend suppliers.
